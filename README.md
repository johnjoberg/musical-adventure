Tracking my Musicianship as an Adult

Hello viewers!

Thanks for visiting; I am on a journey to become a coder/programmer and want to start that journey by creating a project and site that draws from my creative side as a musician. I've recently been recording jams via GarageBand to both track my progression as a guitarist and also to hone my sound engineering skillset.

Cheers,
John Bergin
